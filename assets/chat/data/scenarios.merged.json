    {"id":"hiv_im_decile3_prep_lowshare","label":"Internal Medicine Doctor — Low Descovy share, missed PrEP opportunity","personaKey":"im_decile3","therapeuticArea":"HIV","hcpRole":"Internal Medicine Doctor","background":"Dr. Harper, Decile 3 prescriber, focuses on preventive care but underutilizes PrEP. Descovy TRx share 32%, NBRx 20%. States the clinic lacks many PrEP patients despite increased STI testing among young MSM. Descovy is often prescribed only upon request. Follow-ups and quarterly labs are inconsistent.","goal":"Create urgency around PrEP gaps; commit to proactively prescribe Descovy to appropriate candidates, address renal-safety questions, and implement standardized quarterly PrEP follow-up and labs."},
    {"id":"hiv_np_decile10_highshare_access","label":"Nurse Practitioner — High Descovy share but access and staffing barriers","personaKey":"np_decile10","therapeuticArea":"HIV","hcpRole":"Nurse Practitioner","background":"Alex Nguyen, NP, Decile 10. Descovy TRx 59%, NBRx 64%, unrestricted access 75%. Large panel with adherence challenges. Main constraint is prior authorization workload and workflow friction, which limits breadth of appropriate Descovy prescribing.","goal":"Broaden appropriate Descovy use by batching prior-auths twice weekly, delegating PA tasks to support staff or pharmacy partner, and revisiting generic TDF users with unrestricted coverage."},
    {"id":"hiv_pa_decile9_treat_switch_slowdown","label":"Physician Assistant — Slowing Biktarvy switches","personaKey":"pa_decile9","therapeuticArea":"HIV","hcpRole":"Physician Assistant","background":"Samantha Lee, PA, top-tier HIV clinic, 10+ years experience. Biktarvy share 50%, DVY/TVY 12%, Triumeq 9%. Initial high switching rate has dropped to 1–2 in the past 13 weeks. Belief: most patients are stable and reluctant to switch.","goal":"Reinforce Biktarvy clinical durability and convenience; identify clear switch criteria and integrate a quarterly 'optimization review' to surface candidates."},
    {"id":"hiv_np_decile5_cab_growth","label":"Nurse Practitioner — Favoring CAB over Biktarvy","personaKey":"np_decile5","therapeuticArea":"HIV","hcpRole":"Nurse Practitioner","background":"Jamie Ortiz, NP, ~3 years in HIV care. Biktarvy share down 10% in 4 months; CAB share 7% and growing. Often honors patient requests for long-acting injections without systematic resistance/adherence evaluation.","goal":"Align on CAB candidacy and monitoring criteria, educate on resistance risks, and set a checklist to protect long-term regimen durability."},

    {"id":"hiv_im_decile4_prep_apretude_gap","label":"Internal Medicine MD — PrEP: low Apretude vs Descovy/Truvada","personaKey":"im_decile4","therapeuticArea":"HIV","hcpRole":"Internal Medicine MD","background":"Decile 4 community IM. Panel skews 24–39 MSM and TGNB. PrEP mix last 13 weeks: Descovy 41%, generic TDF/FTC 47%, Apretude 3%. Rising STI testing and missed quarterly PrEP follow-ups. PA backlog for TAF PrEP; no standing lab protocol. Misperception that long-acting injectable requires ultra-adherence.","goal":"Re-segment candidates; offer Apretude to adherence-challenged patients; convert high-risk TDF/FTC users with renal risk to Descovy where access allows; establish nurse-led lab and injection calendar."},
    {"id":"hiv_np_decile9_prep_ops_cap","label":"Nurse Practitioner — PrEP: strong but operationally capped","personaKey":"np_decile9","therapeuticArea":"HIV","hcpRole":"Nurse Practitioner","background":"Decile 9 NP in FQHC. Share: Descovy 58%, TDF/FTC 28%, Apretude 9%. Prior-auth burden caps TAF and Apretude; two MAs rotate PAs manually. Pharmacy partner can run benefits checks but engagement is ad-hoc. New PrEP starts surge after community testing events.","goal":"Batch prior-auths twice weekly with pharmacy tech support, default naive high-risk starts to Descovy when renal/BMD concerns exist, and run a monthly Apretude start day with on-site injections."},
    {"id":"hiv_pa_decile7_treat_switch_day","label":"Physician Assistant — Treatment: slowing Biktarvy switches, CAB/RPV curiosity","personaKey":"pa_decile7","therapeuticArea":"HIV","hcpRole":"Physician Assistant","background":"Decile 7 PA in hospital-affiliated ID clinic. Biktarvy share 52% of TRx; Dovato 14%; Cabenuva 6% and rising among younger adherent patients. Only 1–2 switches in 13 weeks; perception that most patients are optimized. No structured 'switch day'.","goal":"Stand up a quarterly optimization clinic, define Cabenuva candidacy and resistance counseling steps, and track 90-day viral suppression and missed-dose events by regimen."},

    {"id":"onc_md_decile10_io_adc_pathways","label":"Medical Oncologist — IO backbone heavy, ADC toxicity bandwidth","personaKey":"onc_md_decile10","therapeuticArea":"Cancer","hcpRole":"Medical Oncologist","background":"Decile 10 solid-tumor center. First-line shares: Keytruda dominant; Opdivo in select combos; evaluating ADCs such as Enhertu for HER2-low. P&T scrutinizes cost per response and infusion chair time. Prior-auth throughput strong; toxicity management bandwidth for ADCs is the main constraint.","goal":"Define biomarker-driven subset where therapy adds ΔOS/ΔPFS and reduces chair or AE load; commit to add into order sets and tumor-board protocols."},
    {"id":"onc_np_decile6_pathway_ops","label":"Oncology NP — Community site, pathway-driven care","personaKey":"onc_np_decile6","therapeuticArea":"Cancer","hcpRole":"Nurse Practitioner","background":"Decile 6 community infusion center following national pathways. IO doublets used conservatively; step-edits common. Nurse-managed AE clinics prevent ER bounce-backs but are short-staffed. Patient education packets inconsistent for new starts.","goal":"Install standardized NP-led education bundle and toxicity call-tree for the regimen; add drug-specific AE one-pager to pathway handouts."},
    {"id":"onc_pa_decile7_gu_oral_onc_tminus7","label":"Oncology PA — GU subspecialty, oral oncolytic onboarding","personaKey":"onc_pa_decile7","therapeuticArea":"Cancer","hcpRole":"Physician Assistant","background":"Decile 7 PA embedded with GU team. Competition across IO, TKIs, emerging ADCs. Barriers: fragmented oral oncolytic onboarding, late hub forms, and refill gaps at day 25–30.","goal":"Adopt 'T-7 onboarding': hub enrollment at decision day, pharmacy benefits check within 24h, and PA-led toxicity tele-visit at day 10 to lift on-therapy rates through cycle 2."},

    {"id":"vac_id_decile8_adult_flu_playbook","label":"Infectious Disease Specialist — Adult flu program underperforming","personaKey":"id_md_decile8","therapeuticArea":"Vaccines","hcpRole":"Infectious Disease Specialist","background":"Decile 8 ID group managing LTC and high-risk adults. Last season pre-book cut 12%; coverage fell in 65+. Uses mix of Fluzone/Flublok, Fluarix/FluLaval, Fluad/Flucelvax. Supply arrives on time but clinic days launch late and reminder-recall is weak.","goal":"Lock pre-book mix with age-appropriate formulations, schedule four early clinic days, stand up SMS reminders, and publish standing orders across LTC sites."},
    {"id":"vac_np_decile5_primary_care_capture","label":"Family Medicine NP — Primary care hub with fragmented workflows","personaKey":"fm_np_decile5","therapeuticArea":"Vaccines","hcpRole":"Nurse Practitioner","background":"Decile 5 FM clinic. Storage adequate; billing flags denials for high-dose claims in 65+. Staff rotation causes VIS documentation misses. Community demand exists but Saturday clinics are ad-hoc.","goal":"Implement standing orders, pre-shift huddle checklists, and two fixed Saturday clinics in Sept–Oct; add EHR prompts for 65+ high-dose/adjuvanted selection."},
    {"id":"vac_pa_decile6_oh_campus_outreach","label":"Physician Assistant — Occupational health and college outreach","personaKey":"oh_pa_decile6","therapeuticArea":"Vaccines","hcpRole":"Physician Assistant","background":"Decile 6 PA supports employer clinics and a local college. Uptake high among healthcare workers, low among students. Inventory turns slow due to late campus events.","goal":"Run campus pop-ups during orientation and midterms with pre-registration; redistribute excess inventory to employer sites by week 6."},

    {"id":"covid_pulm_md_decile9_antiviral_ddi_path","label":"Pulmonologist — Outpatient antivirals under-utilized","personaKey":"pulm_md_decile9","therapeuticArea":"COVID","hcpRole":"Pulmonologist","background":"Decile 9 pulmonary group with high-risk COPD/ILD. Prefers Paxlovid first line; rarely uses 3-day IV remdesivir due to infusion capacity; molnupiravir for contraindications. Staff uncertainty on drug–drug interaction triage slows prescribing.","goal":"Adopt a rapid DDI triage protocol and a standing remdesivir slot with a partner infusion center for Paxlovid-ineligible patients; set a 48-hour treatment window KPI."},
    {"id":"covid_pulm_np_decile6_postcovid_adherence","label":"Pulmonary NP — Post-COVID clinic, adherence issues","personaKey":"pulm_np_decile6","therapeuticArea":"COVID","hcpRole":"Nurse Practitioner","background":"Decile 6 NP runs follow-up for high-risk patients. Eligible patients often present on day 4–5; pharmacy callbacks delay start. Education on rebound and isolation is inconsistent.","goal":"Implement same-day eRx workflow template, provide patient one-pager on rebound expectations, and route day-2 positives to NP-led tele-start to increase initiation within 48 hours."},
    {"id":"covid_pulm_pa_decile5_hospital_at_home","label":"Pulmonary PA — Hospital-at-home link","personaKey":"pulm_pa_decile5","therapeuticArea":"COVID","hcpRole":"Physician Assistant","background":"Decile 5 PA coordinates transitions. Many discharges qualify for outpatient therapy but lack transportation for IV remdesivir. Home-infusion vendor exists but is underused.","goal":"Default referral to home-infusion for remdesivir day 1–3 when Paxlovid is contraindicated; measure 7-day readmissions pre/post."},

    {"id":"cv_card_md_decile10_hf_gdmt_uptake","label":"Cardiologist — HFrEF clinic with uneven GDMT adoption","personaKey":"card_md_decile10","therapeuticArea":"Cardiovascular","hcpRole":"Cardiologist","background":"Decile 10 cardiology group. Entresto on 62% of eligible HFrEF; SGLT2 use at 38% due to PCP handoffs and copays. Prior-auths routed to fellows; refill gaps at day 30. Earlier generic uncertainty created hesitancy.","goal":"Adopt discharge GDMT checklist plus pharmacy tech enrollment for copay assistance; target +10 percentage points SGLT2 uptake over 90 days and halve 30-day gaps."},
    {"id":"cv_np_decile6_ckd_sglt2_calendar","label":"Cardiology NP — Rural HF program, renal concerns","personaKey":"card_np_decile6","therapeuticArea":"Cardiovascular","hcpRole":"Nurse Practitioner","background":"Decile 6 NP manages titration visits. SGLT2s underused in CKD stage 3 due to misconceptions and infection fears; Jardiance broadly covered. No titration calendar.","goal":"Implement a titration calendar and CKD-safe counseling script; standardize SGLT2 initiation with sick-day rules; track eGFR and UACR at baseline and 12 weeks."},
    {"id":"cv_pa_decile7_postmi_transitions","label":"Cardiology PA — Post-MI and HF transitions","personaKey":"card_pa_decile7","therapeuticArea":"Cardiovascular","hcpRole":"Physician Assistant","background":"Decile 7 PA coordinates inpatient-to-outpatient starts. SGLT2 initiation often deferred to PCP. Entresto starts delayed pending 'echo at 4 weeks.' Readmissions at 30 days above benchmark.","goal":"Start SGLT2s prior to discharge when eligible and convert ACE/ARB to Entresto within 48–72 hours per protocol; schedule pharmacy follow-up at day 7 to prevent abandonment."}
