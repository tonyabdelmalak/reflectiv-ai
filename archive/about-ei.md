## Emotional Assessment Protocols

Emotional intelligence (EI) training works best with an evidence-based, learner-centred approach. Guidance from EI education groups recommends a structured, multi-step process: assess needs and competencies, give clear and supportive feedback, link learning goals to personal values, encourage participation, and help learners set goals and direct their own learning [1][2].

In practical terms, an EI assessment should:

- **Use multiple sources and methods** to evaluate key competencies.  
- **Provide strengths and development areas** in a safe, non-judgemental format.  
- **Motivate learners** by aligning objectives with personal values and choice.  
- **Encourage self-directed learning and goal setting** with periodic check-ins.

These principles underpin ReflectivEI’s **Assess → Personalize → Practice → Reflect** framework. The platform helps users evaluate their communication style, tailor their approach to different healthcare-provider personas, practise interactions, and reflect on feedback.

### Descovy (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide)

- Fixed-dose tablet of FTC/TAF.  
- Approved for PrEP in certain populations and for treatment in combination with other antiretrovirals per label.  
- Considerations when comparing to TDF-containing options include renal and bone safety profiles, access, and plan criteria [3][4].

### Biktarvy (bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide)

- Single-tablet regimen: INSTI (bictegravir) + FTC/TAF.  
- Commonly used for treatment-naïve adults and as a switch option where appropriate.  
- Selection should account for resistance, drug–drug interactions, and guideline alignment [4][5].

### Cabenuva (cabotegravir/rilpivirine long-acting)

- Long-acting injectable regimen of cabotegravir (INSTI) and rilpivirine (NNRTI).  
- Requires confirmed viral suppression and attention to resistance risk, missed-dose management, and clinic workflow for injections [5][6].
