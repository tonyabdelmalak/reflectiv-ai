# Scenario: Decile3IM
HCP_Type: Internal Medicine Doctor
Background: Dr. Harper is a Decile 3 prescriber of HIV medications with limited awareness of Descovy for PrEP. He treats many at-risk patients and focuses on preventive care but underutilizes PrEP in practice. Recent clinic data show steady STI testing volumes in young MSM populations, suggesting a missed prevention opportunity.
Goal for Today: Create urgency around prescribing Descovy for appropriate PrEP candidates, emphasizing its safety and efficacy profile and addressing concerns about renal health.

# Scenario: NP64NBRx
HCP_Type: Nurse Practitioner
Background: Alex Nguyen, NP, maintains a 64% New-to-Brand (NBRx) share for HIV treatments and is known for adopting innovative therapies. Their community clinic manages a large patient base with complex adherence challenges. They are supportive of newer regimens but concerned about time and workflow impact when switching patients.
Goal for Today: Reinforce Biktarvy as a convenient once-daily regimen and introduce Cabenuva as a long-acting alternative for select, adherent patients, highlighting adherence benefits and streamlined follow-up.

# Scenario: PA_TopHIVClinic
HCP_Type: Physician Assistant
Background: Samantha Lee, PA, works in a top-tier HIV clinic with over 10 years of experience. Initially a strong advocate for Biktarvy, her switching rate has slowed in recent months. She notes most patients are already on stable regimens and reluctant to change, citing “if it’s working, why switch?”
Goal for Today: Rebuild confidence in Biktarvy data and outcomes, empowering the PA to proactively identify patients who would benefit from switching and educate them on the long-term benefits.

# Scenario: NP_FavoringCAB
HCP_Type: Nurse Practitioner
Background: Jamie Ortiz, NP, has practiced in HIV care for about 3 years. Recently, her Cabenuva share has grown above national average as patients request the long-acting injectable. While supportive, she tends to over-accommodate requests without evaluating adherence or resistance history.
Goal for Today: Discuss resistance and long-term treatment implications, aligning on criteria for appropriate patient selection and monitoring when using long-acting regimens.
