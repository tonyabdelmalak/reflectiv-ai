    "background": "Dr. Harper, Decile 3 prescriber, focuses on preventive care but underutilizes PrEP. Descovy TRx share 32%, NBRx 20%. States the clinic lacks many PrEP patients despite increased STI testing among young MSM. Descovy is often prescribed only upon request. Follow-ups and quarterly labs are inconsistent.",
    "goal": "Create urgency around PrEP gaps; commit to proactively prescribe Descovy to appropriate candidates, address renal-safety questions, and implement standardized quarterly PrEP follow-up and labs."

    "background": "Alex Nguyen, NP, Decile 10. Descovy TRx 59%, NBRx 64%, unrestricted access 75%. Large panel with adherence challenges. Main constraint is prior authorization workload and workflow friction, which limits breadth of appropriate Descovy prescribing.",
    "goal": "Broaden appropriate Descovy use by batching prior-auths twice weekly, delegating PA tasks to support staff or pharmacy partner, and revisiting generic TDF users with unrestricted coverage."

    "goal": "Align on CAB candidacy and monitoring criteria, educate on resistance risks, and set a checklist to protect long-term regimen durability."
